## Member Service Report

Each member who has consulted a ChocAn provider during that week receives a list of services provided to that member, sorted in order of service date. The report, which is also sent as an e-mail attachment, includes:

-   Member name (25 characters).
-   Member number (9 digits).
-   Member street address (25 characters).
-   Member city (14 characters).
-   Member state (2 letters).
-   Member ZIP code (5 digits).
-   For each service provided, the following details are required:
    -   Date of service (MM–DD–YYYY).
    -   Provider name (25 characters).
    -   Service name (20 characters).

## Provider Service Report

Each provider who has billed ChocAn during the week receives a report, sent as an e-mail attachment, containing the list of services provided to ChocAn members. To simplify the task of verification, the report contains the same information as that entered on the provider’s form, in the order that the data were received by the computer. At the end of the report is a summary including the number of consultations with members and the total fee for that week. That is, the fields of the report include:

-   Provider name (25 characters).
-   Provider number (9 digits).
-   Provider street address (25 characters).
-   Provider city (14 characters).
-   Provider state (2 letters).
-   Provider ZIP code (5 digits).
-   For each service provided, the following details are required:
    -   Date of service (MM–DD–YYYY).
    -   Date and time data were received by the computer (MM–DD–YYYY HH:MM:SS).
    -   Member name (25 characters).
    -   Member number (9 digits).
    -   Service code (6 digits).
    -   Fee to be paid (up to $999.99).
-   Total number of consultations with members (3 digits).
-   Total fee for week (up to $99,999.99).

A record consisting of electronic funds transfer (EFT) data is then written to a disk; banking computers will later ensure that each provider’s bank account is credited with the appropriate amount.

## Accounts Payable Summary Report

A summary report is given to the manager for accounts payable. The report lists every provider to be paid that week, the number of consultations each had, and his or her total fee for that week. Finally, the total number of providers who provided services, the total number of consultations, and the overall fee total are printed.
